# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Introduction: Todo list
  This is a todo list, where you can create, edit and delete your plannings.At first you must enter your firstname and lastname for sign in the program.

## The project content and construction
  I created a project where every registered user can get his own plannings (becouse I thought that every user must get his own plannings, but then i relize that i just need to add hardcode my first and last names in the api url, so but in my opinion it is more flexable that other registered users also can see their own todo list).
  When user at first opens the page , he is an unauthorized part of the project(signIn.js page) must enter required fields first and last names, and after that he will enter the authorized part (BaseLayout, becouse there is some pages i created layout component) and can see the todo list if it contain data or the message that will say that there is no data of any plannings.There is a possibility to sign out.You can add todos , in the todos page there is a button for that. It will navigate to todo form page. There is also a edit and delete actions on the todo row for the specific todo item.I used redux to store user data, becouse it can be necessary in every point in the project.I also added some possibilities like the Alert, Confirm alert, Spinner(spinner also included in redux).There is Routes folder where is the routing of base layout pages.
